bio: "Brazilian developer. Game, music and technology lover.
      I graduated in Information Systems. I love to study and learn new skills, exchange work and study experience with 
      people around me and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web Development since 2012.
      I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development."
